For nearly a half-century, the ball has brought together dancers and non-dancers alike for a night of dancing, performances, and everlasting memories. This event is your chance to get dressed up, participate in a beloved Stanford tradition, and try out some dance moves - or just enjoy the show!The Stanford Viennese Ball was founded in 1978 by students who studied abroad in Vienna and brought home the vibrance and spirit of the Austrian ball season. These Viennese Balls traditionally begin with a lavish opening ceremony featuring honored dignitaries, costumed dancers, and handsomely-clad young couples performing an elegant, choreographed dance. Stanford's first Viennese Ball, held in Toyon Hall, was attended by 350 Stanford students. Since then, the ball has blossomed into a prestigious formal affair held at magnificent off-campus ballrooms. This year, the 45th Annual Viennese Ball will take place on February 25, 2023, in the Hilton San Francisco Union Square.Our event has sold out the last several years. Purchase tickets today to guarantee your spot! Early bird discounts will expire on Tuesday, 2/21/23 at 11:30 PM.For more details, please visit our website vienneseball.com!*All sales are final and no refunds or transfers can be processed for any reason other than an event cancellation by the University. ********* EVENT INFO ********Viennese Ball is first and foremost a time for celebration and merriment with friends. While the ball emphasizes social dance (think waltz, swing, salsa, and so on), you need not be an experienced dancer to have a good time. With performances, live music, contests, a photo booth, and more, there is always something to do for everyone. This is a Stanford tradition that most Stanford students attend at least once during their time at Stanford. Dancers from all around the Bay Area (and many who travel even further!) join us every year from various social dance communities for one of the foremost Viennese Balls to be held outside of Vienna!There will be one waltz room with a live orchestra (Saratoga Symphony), one swing room focused on Lindy Hop and other jazz styles with a live jazz band (Silver Bell Jazz Band), a contemporary room DJ'd by two Bay Area favorites in West Coast Swing and Fusion (Kathleen Sun and Ringo Sanchez), as well as a Latin styles room featuring Salsa, Bachata and more! An event schedule will be made available on our website to showcase events in each room at various parts of the night.The Ball will feature performances by the Opening Committee, Cardinal Ballet Company, Stanford Light Opera Company, Stanford Swingtime, Los Salseros de Stanford, Innovative Styles, Dancesport, Cardinal Swing, and The Academy of Danse Libre.DISCOUNTSWe are offering group discounts of 10% per ticket for groups of 15 or more active Stanford students.

T﻿he brewery is located at 1195 Evans Ave. in the Bayview in San Francisco. Muni is super easy, with the 15, 19, 44 and 54 all stopping close by. If you're taking BART, then hop on thee T-Third Metro which will drop you off at Third & Evans, just a few minutes walk. Parking is typically fairly easy in this neighborhood compared to the rest of San Francisco. And uber/Lyft and taxis are always a great option.Muni: The easiest way to Muni is to  take the T Line that comes to 3rd St, transfer to the 44 bus on Evans Ave, and hop off on Keith St.P﻿arking: There is public street parking on Keith St and Fairfax Ave.The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America’s taps ran dry. The brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco’s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy’s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery’s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.During the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Taproom opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.The brewery’s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery’s original fifteen-barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.Is proof of vaccination or masks required? No. Currently the San Francisco health guidelines do not require vaccines or masks at indoor venues. If you are not feeling well, however, we recommend you stay at home.What time do doors open? Doors open at 7pm with the show starting around 8pm.Do the shows start on time? Pretty close! We try to start each show within 10-15 minutes of the start time. So arrive early if you can!

Founded in 1867 by George Mayes, the ""George Mayes Oyster Saloon & Chophouse"", the restaurant relocated from California Street after the 1906 Earthquake and Fire. When the building burned down, they operated out of a tent until moving to Polk Street at Post, eventually relocating to the current location. The spot used to have a very different past - think separate door to the bar before ladies were allowed, a speakeasy downstairs, or rooms upstairs for, uh, working girls. Mayes' son updated it to an Italian seafood joint, and since then a few other restaurant incarnations were housed in the space. Back in 2009, the new owners resurrected Mayes with a modern vibe and a more ""global"" menu.Today it's the busiest bar/night club on Polk Street.

Witch’s self-titled debut album unfurled like hazy memories of late night revelries in the city center creeping back in on a hungover Sunday morning. Guitarist/vocalist Sade Sanchez purred and crooned over jangling guitar chords, painting pictures of urban exploits, old American haunts, and private escapades with a master’s austerity. Bassist Irita Pai and drummer Ellie English polished the patina of the band’s vintage sound, adding a full-bodied thump and intoxicating swing to the album’s dusty ballads, ominous invitations, and sultry rock songs. The album had an air of effortlessness, like these songs were written into the fabric of the Western landscape by some past generation and conjured into our modern world by three powerful conduits. The band readily admits that L.A. Witch was a casual affair and that the songs came together over the course of several years. That natural flow hit a snag when the band’s popularity grew and they began touring regularly, so a new strategy became necessary for their sophomore album, the swaggering and beguiling Play With Fire.Opening in 1994 in a San Francisco Firehouse as a Local Hangout &  Music Venue, Kilowatt found it's way to being a neighborhood bar. After  3 years as a  punk/rock/indie showcase , with the music scene slowing  almost to a halt due to economic times, a change was made. The stage was transformed into the Dart Area.

As a scientist I was stuck in my head, suppressing my emotions and my body’s messages. My default communication style was to explain, defend, and try to always be right.As you might imagine, this lead to shallow, unfulfilling relationships and a very stressful life trying to figure everything out with my mind (also, sex was terrible).After traveling the world for a year and intentionally saying ‘yes’ to what scared me, something happened that I can only describe as a sexual and spiritual awakening.I became a neo-tantra teacher + sex & relationship coach, and have been studying emotional intelligence, trauma healing, and sexuality ever since, while walking the path of non-dual shaiva tantra.(And yes, switching from studying bonding as a chemist to studying bonding as a sex and relationship coach was as wild an adventure as you might imagine!)",POINT (37.8290323 -122.2644985)

With few job prospects, but a burning desire to change the world, they decided to start a beer company. Genius. Their goal? Brew the world’s first craft radlers, using real fruit and all natural ingredients. They immediately began taking part in extensive market research and hours of high-stress think-tank meetings. After months of preparation, Two Pitchers Brewing Company was born! Confronted with more beer than we knew how to sell, we put our game faces on and got to work.

Meeting in such a vulnerable and safe environment was the perfect catalyst for creating an authentic connection.

Check out the FAQ section on our website!A Puja is an intentional ceremony. In Sanskrit it means reverence, honor, and offering. It's a ritual designed to open our hearts and allow us to see the inner beauty within ourselves and all beings. It invites us into the elegant dance of masculine and feminine in a warm space of oneness and connection. And if you ask us, that's a pretty darn good place to start when it comes to a first date!Participants form two concentric circles. The men form the outside circle and the women form the inside, with each woman facing a man. Each pair then share a meaningful exchange through a directed exercise (a Puja “station”). This can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Then they put their hands together in Namaste, thank each other, and rotate to the next person. The ceremony ends when everyone has rotated a full circle.Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then – just like in yoga – you have the option to modify or completely opt out.  We encourage everyone to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators will demonstrate what that looks like before you begin.Y﻿es! We make sure all our events have an equal number of men and women. Some events are open and some have a specific age range which is stated in the title (though it's merely a suggestion, not a rule). Our open events attract a wide range of age groups – from 19 all the way to 76! For more details, see the FAQ section on our website As many of our attendees say, ""I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!"" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason that probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!This is much more than just a speed dating event. It's about bringing more connection, and perhaps healing, to the masculine and feminine within us. That's the juicy part of a connection that makes relationships so fun. Men learn how to hold a grounded masculine space. And when that happens, women can relax into their feminine and not have to do or hold so much. This creates a new way of relating that is effortless and natural (and not something you'd be able to experience in a bar or on a dating app). We believe this is why people love it so much and why one participant said it will 'restore your hope in dating.'We're happy to answer!

Some upcoming themes include: Excellence,  Education, & Cruelty.We are proudly a member of Intersection for the Arts. Intersection for the Arts is a historic arts nonprofit that provides people working in arts and culture with fiscal sponsorship and resources to grow.The Living Room is but one part of a larger vision to develop an incubator and community-building program for writers with the intent to make being a full-time writer accessible to anyone and not a privilege. *Said another way,* the idea is to dismantle the idea of the full-time writer as a solitary and privileged individual with graduate education and a professorship to sustain their writing. Instead, a full-time writer is a community-uplifting, politically-engaged, financially supported culture bearer who crafts their work, publishes & performs it, is a part of contributing their creative & technical skills to build communities connected to their own passions while also being able to afford housing, dining, and other bills as well as radical self-care like massages and travel. The Living Room serves to help writers develop the necessary skills and to be a conduit for connecting writers into established communities through partnerships and its own programming in scholarship-funded workshops (education), reading series & salons (community & political advocacy), youth mentoring and support through creative writing activities (youth outreach), elder support and capturing of stories from seniors in their own voices while also helping to combat isolation with creativity (senior outreach), support in building all of these writers' careers through a community press and advising for finding and applying to grants and residencies (publishing and advocacy), and getting writers into non-traditional spaces such as business lunch hours (service-learning & corporate accountability). The aim is to prioritize serving BIPOC, formerly incarcerated, survivors of trauma experienced through military service, houselessness, or sexual assault, and neurodivergent writers, but it is a space to build up all.",POINT (37.775147 -122.419256)

No one knew what would happen to him. His wife, at home with four small children, was frantic. King wrote about those hours in darkness in solitary confinement when he could not see or sense light:""You will never know the meaning of utter darkness until you have lain in such a dungeon, knowing that sunlight is streaming overhead and still seeing only darkness below. You might have thought I was in the grip of fantasy brought on by worry. I did worry. But there was more to the blackness than a phenomenon conjured up by a worried mind, Whatever the cause, the fact remained that I could not see the light.""

Self-care and self-exploration are most deliciously done through experiences. We invite you to luxuriate in your senses and nurture your mind, body and spirit with this Sunday’s Sacred Trio: Breathwork, Cacao/Elixir, and Sound Bath by master facilitator Mandy Hamilton. Each of these modalities are potent on their own and together they are transcendent. Breathwork expands your awareness and moves stuck energy out of your body; Cacao or Turmeric Elixir activates your clarity and enhances your mood; Sound Baths relax and reharmonize your mind and body. Think of this as a tune up for all parts of you.Cacao or Elixir*Meet Mandy’s favorite food (chocolate). If you haven’t tried cacao, you’re in for a real treat. Our evening will start with an optional 4 oz serving of ceremonial cacao or a soothing turmeric elixir. Cacao is the raw form of chocolate that is consumed as a thick delicious beverage. Drinking this special form of cacao has many benefits, it increases blood flow, boosts mood, sharpens the mind, and grounds you in the present moment. Cacao is the most antioxidant rich superfood on the planet and has high levels of Theobromine, a compound that boosts cognitive functioning and mood. Theobroma translates from the greek: theo = god and broma = food. So you will be having “food of the gods” according to the Greeks and Mayans.  *﻿A Turmeric Elixir will also be offered for those sensitive to the activating properties of cacao or simply prefer to try something different. BreathworkWe will then transition to a 15 minute journey with Holotropic Breathwork. Holotropic Breathwork is a 3 part breath that hyper-oxygenates the body. Breathing in this way moves toxins, stagnant energy and stuck emotions out of the body; it allows you to find deep forms of relaxation and mental insight; it rebalances your system and brings you back into a restful nervous system. Sound BathOur evening will be completed by a symphonic sound bath combining ancient Tibetan bowls, crystal bowls, gong, and other special instruments that you’ve likely never heard before. Mandy is an extensively trained sound practioner. Her melodies will sink you into deep relaxation and bring you back into harmony. You will leave the evening feeling centered and deeply nourished.Mandy is a former type-A go-getter turned spirit guide, life coach and sound practioner. She incorporates tools and techniques proven by modern science with esoteric and ancient shamanism to help people feel totally at home in their mind, body and spirit. Her trainings are vast and deep. She draws upon her work in Venture Capital, her published psychology research on behavior change, her years as a professional level athlete, and the following certifications: Master Coach, NLP Master Level Practioner, Holotropic Breathwork, Reiki Master Level and Sound Healing 100hr, Shamanism and Psychedelic Integration.

Featuring performances by Donna Personna, Collette LeGrande, Olivia Hart, Carla Gay, Renita Valdez, & BeBe Sweetbriar, plus MCs Juanita More & Sister Roma!No universal history of drag exists, and no two queens define the art-form the same way. Drag can be an entrance point for another modality, or a doorway into another world. People step through the same door, but end up in different places. Drag is transformation, shapeshifting, ritual, magic. There exists a certain spirit accessible only on the stage or in the streets.On the evening of the 2017 winter solstice, The Hot Boxxx Girls took the stage at Aunt Charlie’s Lounge. Clad in sequins, hair piled high, with glittering eyelids and raw emotion, they deftly seduced their audience. It was evident to all who bore witness: these are not mere queens, but legends. A portal opened.Legends of Drag is an archive of living drag history, featuring portraits and stories from drag queen elders in cities across the country. Inspired by that night at Aunt Charlie’s, artists Harry James Hanson, Devin Antheus, and Deb Leal began the project in the spring of 2018. It has grown to include 81 queens in 16 cities. Those portraits were published as Legends of Drag: Queens of A Certain Age in May 2022, from Abrams Books. Legends of San Francisco spotlights our local models, in the city where it all began.The photographs are shot on location and styled with extravagant floral designs. The inclusion of floral elements both highlights the queens’ uniqueness, and alludes to the ephemeral nature of drag itself. Each portrait session is a collaboration between artists and model, jointly selecting the location, styling, and blooms. By transporting the queens from nightlife to daytime, we position each model as a fixture within her community. Mixing sunlight and artificial light is intentionally harsh, yet unapologetically glamorous. Hanson and Antheus’ digital portraits deify each of their subjects, while Leal’s analog film adds more context for this magical world. The resulting body of work is simultaneously formal, conceptual, and surreal.Mainstream drag's preoccupation with youth culture rarely creates space for elder queens, despite their fundamental role in building a world where queer youth can thrive. It is imperative to document the queens who are not on television— the unsung heroes of local dives, performers who have championed their art for decades, even when it meant risking their safety. Through Legends of Drag, we are nurturing a community of care for queer and trans elders, who have so much wisdom to share. We’ve seen firsthand the tremendous amount to be gained through intergenerational exchange. Legends of Drag honors the legacy of these queens as survivors, trailblazers, and cultural ambassadors. As demanded in recent years, we want to give the girls their flowers.",POINT (37.783723 -122.414242)

When the building burned down, they operated out of a tent until moving to Polk Street at Post, eventually relocating to the current location. The spot used to have a very different past - think separate door to the bar before ladies were allowed, a speakeasy downstairs, or rooms upstairs for, uh, working girls. Mayes' son updated it to an Italian seafood joint, and since then a few other restaurant incarnations were housed in the space.

Check the schedule for future classes & who's teaching (2x a month on Wednesday eves).instructor/artist/host bios:LISELOTTE | instructor. Liselotte Singer (France) works in the fields of somatic practices, improvisation and creation in contemporary dance. She now lives in Marseille. She graduated from the degree ""Dance, Context, Choreography"" in HZT, Berlin where she lived between 2012 and 2021, and is currently studying for a Master's degree in Dance at Université Paris 8.After having worked for different choreographers based in Berlin as an assistant and per-former, she now wants to give back a main place to collective and collaborative practices in her artistic life, with a strong objective of sharing and transmitting also beyond the dance world. She focuses in particular on the development of a method of improvisation in movement in which touch with the hands is the fundamental element (HANDS IN).When working alone she explores anatomical and psychosomatic knowledge that she continues to glean from all possible contexts, imaginary, scientific, theoretical and applied. She is as much about imploding her experience of body and perception as she is about finding a link between bodies and their representations. This practice functions as an undercurrent and feeds all her projects.EZRA | instructor. Ezra LeBank (Los Angeles) is a Professor of Movement at California State University Long Beach. Meditation, Aikido, and acrobatics work their way into his curiosity of CI. His approach is inspired by many wonderful teachers including Nancy Stark Smith, Ray Chung, and Andrew Harwood. He has been invited as a teacher at International Contact Festival Freiburg, West Coast Contact Improv Jam, Seattle Festival for Dance Improvisation, Poland Contact Festival, and at CI@50 in Oberlin, Ohio. His research asks the question if we can fly and fall without noticing much.D﻿AN | artist. Dan Gorelick is a Brooklyn and SF based musician who works with cello, voice, and synthesis to create expressive electronic soundscapes. His musical style is influenced by his upbringing as a classical cellist, improvisational jazz, and exploration in different forms of sound design. His performances integrate acoustic practices with various technologies to explore sonic possibilities between the two. IG @dqgorelick | venmo @dqgorelickMERRICK | evening host. Merrick Jacob (she/her) is a lover of movement, continuously in awe of the body and its potential for unique expression, creativity, & authentic connection. Influenced by her practices of figure skating, AcroYoga, hand-balancing, and contact improv, she guides playful movement experiences as an opportunity for deep listening, exploration, and co-creation. She is a certified AcroYoga Teacher with AcroRevolution & AcroYoga Montréal. Merrick studied a variety of somatic movement therapy modalities with Dynamic Embodiment & The Moving On Center: School of Participatory Arts & Somatic Research, focusing on BodyMind Centering & Laban Movement Analysis.

Sonically addictive, the relentless and unflinching production serves only to increase the power behind Waters’ stark lyricism. At its core “STAR KILLER” is a personal commentary for Waters, who is navigating new success whilst also staying true to his identity as a first generation immigrant from Nepal.   Following one billion streams on his debut album 'Pity Party,' Curtis Waters followed up with the  electrifying post-punk single 'MANIC MAN' - a brutally honest reflection on identity, insecurity, and mental health. The 22-year old singer, songwriter, & producer has earned over 150K YouTube subscribers, 60K IG followers, and 138K on Tik-Tok - earning him over 100M views across platforms. After the growth of his viral hit 'Stunnin,' the Nepali-born creative was covered by the likes of Rolling Stone, Billboard, and Pigeons & Planes. He quickly launched himself into collaborations with acts like renforshort, Kim Petras, and Brevin Kim alongside serving as the ambassador for major brands including MCM, Mercedes, and Haagen Dazs. After experiencing rapid online success, the multi-hyphenate spent time re-imagining his creative identity & sound, working with artists like TiaCorine, Shrimp, and greek as he built a new world. His forthcoming album is a true immigrant story, a reflection on a young, brown creative being thrown into the mainstream overnight, while navigating deep issues of self-doubt & cultural identity along the way.",POINT (37.776325 -122.420246)

Founded in 1867 by George Mayes, the ""George Mayes Oyster Saloon & Chophouse"", the restaurant relocated from California Street after the 1906 Earthquake and Fire. When the building burned down, they operated out of a tent until moving to Polk Street at Post, eventually relocating to the current location. The spot used to have a very different past - think separate door to the bar before ladies were allowed, a speakeasy downstairs, or rooms upstairs for, uh, working girls. Mayes' son updated it to an Italian seafood joint, and since then a few other restaurant incarnations were housed in the space. Back in 2009, the new owners resurrected Mayes with a modern vibe and a more ""global"" menu.Today it's the busiest bar/night club on Polk Street.

Having released on notable labels such as Swamp81, Encrypted Audio and Eatmybeat, he has quite a repertoire of deep, dark and versatile bass music productions under his belt. With his mission to spread quality vibes and music unconfined by genre or BPM. Manchester-based young gun Hypho trades off brazen grime stylings, lush garage interludes and dubbed out bass riddims with fearsome snatches of ragga energy. An incredibly prolific producer who’s still in his early 20s, he has already picked up support for his inimitable style of production from the likes of Deekline, Endor, Majora UK, Marcus Nasty and Mark Radford.HEBBE - Dubstep, Deep DubRotterdam .

Psychedelic Sangha is an organization that was founded on the idea of providing a safe space for those ""misfit seekers"" interested in responsibly exploring the relationship between dharma and psychedelics practice.For this event, which combines a talk and a guided meditation, I will share some of what I have learned as co-founder of Psychedelic Sangha. We’ll look at what worked and what didn’t. We will then focus on the Tibetan Buddhist practice of Vajrasattva as a powerful container for engaging in both rigorous meditation practice and exploring psychedelics/cannabis.Vajrasattva practice is a form of deity yoga intended to purify one's bad karma, including the healing of trauma. It is a powerful methodology that employs focused attention, mantra, ritual, and the skillful use of archetypal symbolism to engender purification and healing. Vajrasattva practice can be found in all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism as well as in certain forms of Chinese and Japanese Buddhism. It is an open practice that requires no initiation.This event will include a guided meditation after the talk.Christopher “Doc” Kelley is co-founder and organizer of Psychedelic Sangha. He received a PhD in religion from Columbia University where he studied Indo-Tibetan Buddhism with Robert A. F. Thurman.

A﻿bout the Film:Mumia Abu-Jamal is the most recognized death row inmate in the world today. In 1982, he was was tried and convicted for the murder of Police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Since then, the Abu-Jamal trial proceedings have come under scrutiny and today his case is one of the most contested legal cases in modern American history. A former Black Panther and now renowned author, his books and writings in venues as diverse as the Yale Law Review, Forbes, Nation and street-papers for the homeless, have led many to hail him the voice of the voiceless. Justice on Trial navigates the tempest of the Abu-Jamal trial by reviewing the known facts of the case. It demonstrates that the major violations in the Abu-Jamal case -- judicial bias, prosecutorial misconduct, racial discrimination in jury selection, police corruption and tampering with evidence to obtain a conviction-- are not special to this case. Instead, they are commonly practiced within the criminal justice system and account for the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans and Latinos in the United States. The case of Mumia Abu-Jamal is a microcosm of greater problems in the criminal justice system in the United States today. The attention that its many violations have received make the Abu-Jamal case one of the most important civil rights cases of our time.",POINT (37.732431 -122.391521)

His sound is undeniable in character and is breathing new life into the techno house world.Growing up in Newport Beach, California, he secluded himself in skating, surfing and music since a young age. His father, a musician and producer of classic rock, provided a pivotal role in creating his passion and drive for the raw and electric sound he loves to play today. Since 2006, his production style has constantly evolved whilst trying to stay true to his roots of groove laden, rock inspired minimal ‘’surf ‘’techno.2012 was a big year for Skyler, it provided him the opportunity to develop and create his new solo career and moniker, SHADED. His previous success was as the duo SHDWPLAY, but his decision to go solo ultimately came from his desire for more creative and individual freedom.As SHDWPLAY, the duo released four EPs on Dubfire’s SCI+TEC Digital Audio Imprint, quickly becoming well-regarded staples in techno ranks around the world. Their unique sound, exemplified in cuts like ‘Time Drip’ and ‘Drug of Choice,’ were heard in DJ sets from Richie Hawtin to Dubfire himself, solidifying their presence in the electronic dance world and as official members of the SCI+TEC family.This newfound recognition, coupled with the desire for creative individuality, prompted his decision to leave and to pursue his solo career. Since the creation of SHADED in 2012, he has been playing his LIVE sets worldwide from festivals in Mexico and Croatia to clubs in London, Berlin, and Brazil. From touring with the SCI + TEC family and playing along side Dubfire and Carlo Lio he has gained recognition throughout the industry as one of the top LIVE acts, exciting crowds with his brand of ‘’funkadelic’’ techno. Through touring with SCI + TEC, fans and admiration for his style of music have grown considerably, leading to increased demand for his solo performances.On SCI + TEC he has had multiple EP’s in both the techno and minimal charts in 2012 and 2013 including the hit tracks ‘’Be My Binge’’, ‘’Love Bug’’ and ‘’This Is This’’. His musical output has gained much respect from industry heavy weights including Dubfire, Richie Hawtin, Joseph Capriati, Tiga, Slam and Sasha. This year his major noted release on SCI +TEC was the EP ‘‘Dwell’’ that reached #1 on the Top 100 Minimal Release charts via Beatport. After the success of ‘’Dwell’’ he followed up with his most recent EP – ‘’SHE SHE’’, his debut release on Tiga’s Turbo Recordings in June 2014, solidifying his production versatility.-﻿----------L﻿yjahttps://soundcloud.com/lyjalifeL﻿isa Rosehttps://soundcloud.com/lisa-roseE﻿lzhttps://soundcloud.com/djelzC﻿ole Odinhttps://soundcloud.com/coleodin-﻿--------Follow us on Instagram @monarchsfSee our full calendar at monarchsf.com21+Void Sound System",POINT (37.7809714 -122.4083336)

After graduating he moved to New York City to pursue acting, but also started picking up some small venue gigs. When he realized that he was more excited about playing dive bars than Broadway, he packed up and headed out west to California. There he teamed up with fellow TUIB alum, Jenner Fox, forming the band Odell Fox. They started touring almost immediately, cultivating an energetic and intimate live show experience that R.O. has continued to build upon as a solo artist. They moved to Austin, TX, where they released two records, the Moon Shiner EP, in 2016, and Thank You, in 2017. When the band parted ways at the end of 2017, R.O. stayed in Austin, gigging regularly in the hallowed venues of that world famous music scene. It was then he developed the full-band, electrified sound that you can hear on 2020’s King Electric Sessions, his first release since leaving Odell Fox. These days he typically tours solo, allowing for a focus on his distinctive turns of phrase and acrobatic vocals, always accompanied by an easy and warm stage presence. R.O. has drawn comparisons to Ray LaMontagne, Josh Ritter, and Nathaniel Rateliff, and is currently based in San Diego, CA.Cuchulain is a low-voiced songwriter with a wry wit. The NPR Music-featured folk singer released an album of long distance pandemic collaborations called FEAT on Nov 5, 2021 that has been called ""an as-yet-unpublished portion of the Great American Songbook."" Cuchulain's deep baritone and clever lyrics have drawn comparisons to Randy Newman, Leonard Cohen, and Johnny Cash. From rooms as big as the Kennedy Center or as small as a friend's living room, Cuchulain's lyrics have brought laughs and tears to audiences across the US. His Sing In The Shower single release tour took him across the US and Europe in the summer of 2022. His new single “That’s Right, I’m Millenial!” is out now and taking the world by storm.

The beverage menu is made complete with ""signature Grog"".Grog is a drink of historical significance and supports Barbarossa’s Barbary Coast sensibility perfectly. This drink was often consumed by pirates and sailors, mixing three main ingredients: spirit, citrus and water. The citrus was used to ward off scurvy, while the spirit (typically rum) was used to keep the water from going rancid. Grog is served Collins-style. Each grog may be ordered with the patron’s own spirit of choice, although it goes best with Whiskey or Bourbon.In addition to the cocktail menu, Barbarossa offers a selection of beer (12 on tap), wine, and selection of champagne. The bar also features champagne flights, champagne both by the bottle (approximately 30) and by the glass, of harder-to-find varietals. This is somewhat in homage to its former concept and as they still have access to one of the most curated champagne selections in the Bay Area.Barbarossa's food menu is simple, reasonably priced, and meant to share. The menu is broken down into four main categories that were popular on menus during 19th century: “from the ocean” (raw bar), “leaves, fruits and roots,” “meats & cheeses,” and “dessert.” The “from the ocean section” prominently features oysters, both local and imported. Popular items include Sausages (current vendor, Foreign Cinema/ShowDogs) as well as the Red Pastrami. All oysters will be served with 4-5 different, seasonal vinaigrettes; all flavor profiles are meant to support the cocktails.For table reservations send a text to415-830-2777We are drinking and dancing tonight!",POINT (37.79567 -122.403263)

At home they are just sisters, but on stage, they are The Salvations. Ruth, Esther, and Chloe have been singing and dancing in harmony since they could speak. Thanks to the rigorous direction of their mother, Vivian, they’ve become a bona fide girl group whose shows are the talk of the Jazz-era Fillmore.Now Vivian has scored a once-in-a-lifetime offer from a talent manager, who promises to catapult The Salvations into the national spotlight. Vivian knows this is the big break she’s been praying for. But sometime between the hours of rehearsal on their rooftop and the weekly gigs at the Champagne Supper Club, the girls have become women, women with dreams that their mother cannot imagine.The neighborhood is changing, too: all around the Fillmore, white men in suits are approaching Black property owners with offers. One sister finds herself called to fight back, one falls into the comfort of an old relationship, another yearns to make her own voice heard. And Vivian, who has always maintained control, will have to confront the parts of her life that threaten to splinter: the community, The Salvations, and even her family.Margaret Wilkerson Sexton, born and raised in New Orleans, studied creative writing at Dartmouth College and law at UC Berkeley.

Within a few years the Institute was offering classes in mechanical drawing, industrial design, electrical science, and applied mathematics; had started a chess club and had acquired a magnificent library that slaked San Francisco’s voracious appetite for technical and pleasurable reading material.
Today the Mechanics’ Institute continues as a membership organization boasting a fantastic general-interest library, active cultural event calendar, and world renowned chess club. It is a favorite of avid readers, writers, downtown employees, students, film lovers, chess players, and the 21st century nomadic worker in search of a place for literary pursuits, thinking, research and study.

If you are a new, long-time, or prospective member the Tour of the Institute will orient you to our building, include an overview of our history and mission, and outline our current services and the benefits of membership. Tours typically take 45 to 60 minutes.

Henry has a background in anthropology, Latin American Studies, and architecture and has worked in public health, fashion, architecture, and furniture design. While living in Quito, Ecuador, he found himself without access to basic Asian pantry items. Always cooking and sharing food, he started making his own dumpling dough, which ultimately led to starting a small dumpling catering company. He returned stateside in 2011, where he worked at Hodo Foods for eleven years before leaving his job to pursue his own food projects full-time. Henry has consistently immersed himself in all things food: he worked at the farmers market for Green Gulch Farms for six years, taught many corporate dumpling making workshops, led food tours for Edible Excursions, and popped up in various venues focusing on Taiwanese classics (like his version of Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup!). As he pursues the next stage of his career, Henry continues to discover and further his connection to Taiwanese culture through exploration of its cuisine.About Dumpling Club (@dumplingclubsf)Dumpling Club  was started in 2020 by Cathay Bi, a former Google veteran turned food entrepreneur. Dumpling Club started out producing small-batch frozen dumplings using local and seasonal produce and has since grown to include many other products. Today, we are increasingly focused on the wonderful community we’ve built around learning to cook Chinese & Asian dishes. Cooking is the heart of what we do, whether that’s teaching you something simple like how to prepare frozen dumplings, or something more advanced like how to properly steam fish.

O’Neill’s quintet has achieved a seamless and powerful telepathy.Best known for his twenty-five year stint as lead vocalist with Santana, Lindsay appeared on seven of their albums including the multi-platinum Supernatural, winning 11 GRAMMY awards.

When you look at history, you see that ancient civilizations all over the world have used psychoactive plants as part of their culture.  Stone carvings found throughout Mexico and all throughout South America depict ingestion of psychoactive plants and fungi dating back to 1000 BCE.  In Algeria, Spain and Bulgaria, cave murals show psilocybin mushrooms that date back to neolithic times. In Africa,  iboga has been used for possibly thousands of years.  In ancient Siberia, Lithuania and northern Scandinavian lapland, Amanita Muscaria has been documented as part of the indigenous shamanic traditions.  Today, we are experiencing a psychedelic renaissance where modern societies are finally recognizing the benefits of Sacred Medicine.  The positive effects of microdosing on the human psyche are too substantial to ignore. When used consciously and carefully, psychedelics and sacred medicine can help resolve traumas, PTSD, CPTSD, anxiety, depression, addictions, mental and emotional imbalances, and so on.  Microdosing can help stabilize & balance mood, heal trauma & promote compassion, release addictions, chronic worry & compulsions, lower anxiety, fear & depression.  On a physiological level, microdosing can lower inflammation & oxidative stress, enhance healing & immune function, increase energy, performance & vitality, protect the brain & nervous system from cognitive decline.Mentally, microdosing promotes brain health, improves memory, focus & acuity, protects the nervous system, encourages neuroplasticity, brain regeneration &slowed aging and improves your ability to listen & communicate. On a spiritual level, microdosing enhances your sense of connection, compassion & empathy, supports soul discovery & purpose, increases self-awareness, presence, perspective & consciousness and helps you access flow states.  Microdosing opens minds and hearts to the magic and mysteries of the non-physical world, the spiritual world and the Quantum field.   Microdosing can be used intentionally to heal emotional and mental imbalances, improve physiology and ascend spiritually. But like in anything, these sacred medicines, when used improperly, can cause harm. Even water, if drunk in excess, can cause death or water intoxication. Thus, awareness, education and discernment are imperative.  Know the ins-and-outs of microdosing to harness the most out of this self-healing practice. Dosages, protocols, journaling and which medicines are appropriate for your situation will be discussed.  Preparation, integration and other supportive practices will also be discussed and handouts will be provided.  HOUSEKEEPING: This is a sober meeting and not a venue for obtaining psychoactive drugs. In this safe, healing container, we refrain from judging and advice-giving unless it is requested. This sacred circle is a venue for sharing, harm reduction, exchanging insights, ideas and information, meeting new friends and nurturing community. Please log in 5-10 minutes early so we can start on time.PLEASE NOTE: Please register at least one hour before event starts.

This creates a profound shift in perspective as you begin to release old templates and narratives that no longer serve you.The transformational journey of Awakening takes you from a state of not knowing to Knowing, from ignorance to the path of Wisdom & Knowledge, leading us from Victim mentality to the Victor state & eventually to the Vehicle state as you become an instrument for Divine expression.This is the Sacred Journey that ushers you all the way to Self-realization and Liberation, freeing you from earthly suffering, transcending worldly attachments, aversions, judgements & resistance, enabling you to experience unbridled joy, love, peace and equanimity as Pure Awareness. The Awakening process is primarily for individuals who are:1. Feeling stuck, stressed, anxious, disconnected, dissociated2. Suffering from intrusive thoughts, self-loathing, addictions, self-criticism & self sabotage3. Wanting to improve relationship with self & others as well as elevate quality of life4. Seeking to claim self-agency, sovereignty, responsibility & ownership of self5. Ready to unlock profound intuition, soul connection, mindfulness & meditation6. Looking to transcend limiting beliefs, grow in awareness, courage, deep self-work, confront unconscious material, shadow work, release traumas & energies that no longer serveWe incorporate Pranayama, Meditation, Chanting, Mantras, Mudras, Asana and Somatic practices to anchor your expanding Awareness as you gain mastery over your Body-Mind organism.

Go to our Eventbrite page now to sign up for the VIP Crab Club and reserve your Dungeness Crab 🦀 free of charge!WHAT IS SUPER FRESH™ DUNGENESS CRAB?Our trademarked Super Fresh™ Dungeness Crab is a process developed by Crab on the Run where we source the live crab, cook it, ice it immediately and/or prepare it as the customer request and deliver it, Dock to Door all in about an hour!! Because of this process it is very laborious which adds quite a cost to the final delivered product.Super Fresh Dungeness crab is not for everyone. If you plan fundraisers or larger events such as crab feeds our price points would not help you. Unfortunately because of the process of what we do and to bring you the most fresh crab anywhere it is very laborious for our company to manage this process. Crab that is used for crab feeds and other fundraisers is usually frozen several times over before it hits the local suppliers or the grocery retail outlets. Every time the crustacean is frozen the meat is compromised a little bit at a time. The quality is reduced considerably and the taste and texture changes dramatically. Once the crab arrives locally it might even be frozen and thawed out a few more times waiting to be purchased by the consumer or clubs and organizations. Think about it, what happens to the crab in the refrigeration units at Costco or other grocery stores when you walk out and close the doors? Their refrozen and await the next day of sales. It is very rare that the crab used in retail or for these type of events is local crab. It is almost always sent from the North West Coast - Alaska, Washington or Oregon. Local distributors such as Crab on the Run take care of restaurants, hotel facilities, caterers, some mobile food operators, and other food vendors. Many of the local fishermen also sell direct to the consumer off their boats for eager customers that want to get out and explore the coastal cities and take the time and effort to purchase live or cook fresh crab. In fact permits for grocery stores and other retail outlets to cook crab on their premises do not exist. Dungeness Crab season opening in Northern California January 1st, the Rockstar of the world of crab! 🦀A rich buttery taste right, sweet right out of the shell, it's exactly why Dungeness Crab will even temp the trendiest of King Crab connoisseurs. As for our Alaskan King Crab fans it's a very sad season indeed as there will be no fresh Alaskan King Crab available this year for the first time ever, due to a major shortage of a very large amount of crab which has vanished over the last few years from he frigid Alaskan waters.Recipes, ideas and delights for Dungeness crab.EXCELLENT Steamed and Cracked, in a bouillabaisse, or Ciopinno, or how most enjoy it with some hot buttered sauce or delicious crab cocktail.

The show will feature new works from the artist’s latest series of paper sculptures alongside corresponding stop-motion videos of the sculptures. The opening reception for Phase Shift is Saturday, February 25th, 2023 from 6-9pm. It is free and open to the public. The exhibition will be on view to the public until March 25th, by appointment only.Phase Shift is inspired by zoetropes and phenakistoscopes, which are early animation devices that produce the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion. Zai is drawn to these analog forms of creating the illusion of movement. In many of her pieces, she’ll create a series of paper structures in which each unit is slightly different from the last. Zai photographs them sequentially to create short, animated films. Her stop-motion films play with the contrast between the analog materials (paper, thread), and surrealist animation.These variations can signify how identity is entirely situational, and change is our only constant. Divecha breaks these ideas down in a uniquely elegant way by taking the self out of it entirely and using minimalist geometric forms to illustrate how what we might see as static is actually changing incrementally over time. Folded white paper, light, and shadow are the only elements employed in creating these pieces, and the stop-motion recording allows us to see that incremental change happening before our eyes. The body of work presented as a whole is meant to create a calming experience for the viewer by turning the volume down on sensory input with an all-white palette so the viewer can ruminate on the subtlety of change. Other works in this collection employ a sense of tension in their compositions that imply movement or the prospect of it, like a stack of rice grains about to tumble. You might feel you need to hold your arms under the artwork to catch all the pieces that look like they could topple over. Phase Shift will also include a site-specific installation filling the atrium of the gallery that explores polyhedral transformations. As viewers walk around the installation, they will see each subtle change in the shape of a form that eventually results in an entirely different form. Viewers will essentially get to walk through an enlarged version of one of Zai Divecha’s stop-motion videos.",POINT (37.774698 -122.408293)

Mid-Winter Camp offers children the opportunity for safe outdoor play in small, cooperative groups. For 52 years Slide Ranch has welcomed Bay Area youth and has been a cornerstone of Marin’s environmental conservation and education movement. We recognize that we have an important role to play as stewards of federally protected land, organic farmers and ranchers, and environmental educators. Now more than ever children need to be outdoors, for their mental, emotional and physical health, and we feel fortunate to be able to provide an inspirational place for them to explore and thrive.This program will take place during February break, Tuesday 2/21-Friday 2/24 from 9:30am-2:30pm.  There is no camp on Monday 2/20!  Multi-age groups of children (5 years old and up) will spend the day outside, exploring the magnificent and fascinating landscape of Slide Ranch, under the guidance of a Slide Ranch Outdoor Instructor. Mid-Winter Camp also welcomes Junior Environmental Educators, 14-18 years old, who cultivate their youth leadership and environmental education skills with their Slide Ranch instructor as a mentor.The Slide Ranch landscape offers a rich variety of ecosystems, from native plants and animals in the coastal scrub to the rocky inter tidal zones of the coast, at the edge of the continent! We also represent the edge where the wildlands meet human habitation and agriculture, with a herd of goats and sheep on pasture, bee hives, chickens and ducks, and an organic garden. These environments naturally inspire wonder and curiosity and myriad possibilities for observation and inquiry-based learning.Our approach is student-centered, and inquiry and project-based. Campers participate in hands-on activities: exploring the coastal scrub ecosystem of Slide Ranch trails and marine ecology at our amazing tide pools, interacting with farm animals and learning about their roles on the farm. The camp also includes organic gardening projects: sowing seeds, composting, harvesting and cooking.Slide Ranch adheres to CDC, MHHS (Marin Health and Human Services) and the GGNRA (Golden Gate National Recreation Area) for safety guidelines. As of now, masking is not required, regardless of vaccination status, in outdoor spaces. Since our camps operate outside, we do not anticipate requiring masking and will quickly update participants if new restrictions are put in place. As always, all participants are welcome to continue wearing their masks and take extra precautions as needed. We also highly encourage all participants to still pack a mask in cases of severe weather where we will have to go indoors.  We believe so much in the transformative power of camp that we are committed to ensuring that no child is denied an experience at Slide Ranch because of financial need. We’re here to help! We will work with you to make camp a possibility for your family.

Movement can expand what feels possible in ourselves, bringing awareness to the space already within us, a space through which pleasure, sensation, and loving awareness can pour through our bodies. Movement can also expand what feels possible in our connections, inviting us to drop into a deeper listening to ourselves and others, providing a space for experimentation, vulnerability, and witness.This workshop is inspired by artist Yuzo Nakano's pursuit of three basic human desires: reproducing one's experiences, recording (storing) them, and transmitting them to other people. This workshop will play with our experience of visual art (specifically looking at Nakano's artwork and creative approach) and invite us to store and transmit those experiences through movement.The session will begin with a warm-up for us to center in our own bodies through meditation and imagery prompts. We will then open our awareness through group and partner activities that invite play and connection. This workshop is designed for people of any and all movement experience. Activities will include lying down, standing, and moving through the space, and modifications and alternatives will be offered as needed.Workshop participants are invited to the gallery walk of Fossils of Language with artist Yuzo Nakano at 2pm.About the instructor: Chi Chi Chang has worked for the past five years as a classroom teacher, outdoor educator, and movement facilitator. In all these contexts, they have been humbled to be able to do the joyful and rigorous work of facilitating the transformation and growth of people of all ages. Chi Chi studied Dance, Sociology, and Spanish at Middlebury College including courses in technique, improvisation, performance art, and choreography.

Colin Smith (Tom Courtney) is idling in a reform school after having robbed a bakery. Encouraged by the school governor, he trains as a marathoner. He sees the sport as his ticket out of the reformatory, but struggles with the authorities he despises. The film was damned and praised simultaneously on its release. Its gritty look, hand held camera, minimal lighting, and intentional lack of polish received mixed reviews, but its ideology was even more noteworthy. The film's disrespect for social institutions caused an uproar among some circles. Today it holds a place in the British Film Institute's Top 100 British films of all time. CinemaLit February 2023: The British New WaveAs the Mostly British Film Festival plays the Vogue Theatre this month in San Francisco, CinemaLit is screening four great films of the British New Wave: Look Back in Anger (1959), The Entertainer (1960), Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962). From 1959 to 1963, British cinema came forth with a series of startlingly raw films portraying the struggles of the laboring classes in the Midlands and Northern England. Spare, diamond-hard, and deeply felt, these ""kitchen sink dramas"" were made on small budgets and directed by mavericks just beginning their careers, including Tony Richardson, Karel Reisz, John Schlesinger, and Bryan Forbes. The films hold up brilliantly sixty years later; their harsh judgments of wealth and social class haven't aged a day. Revel, too, in the powerhouse acting of four actors at the peak of their powers: Richard Burton (Look Back in Anger), Laurence Olivier (The Entertainer), Albert Finney (Saturday Night and Sunday Morning), and Tom Courtney (The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner). Combined, they embody the dispossessed and embittered forgotten men of austere postwar England as envisioned by John Osborne, Alan Sillitoe, Shelagh Delaney, and other screenwriters, novelists, and playwrights of the era.",POINT (37.7888454 -122.403035)

People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop.They are ready to hear your message.Are you ready to give it to them?Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world.You have a voice, it’s time to use it.You have a story, it’s time to tell it.You have a message, it’s time to share it.Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met.That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking.You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you?You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos.You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be.It still feels weird not being able to see people.You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera.You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos.Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change?You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now.When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it.During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields.The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s.I joined the second wave late.  I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube  had been created.I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created.I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016.I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft.When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online.  I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down.  I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses have struggled or even sadly closed up shop.There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too.I knew how to communicate online.I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual.We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom.  We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos.  We still have people who are hoping things will “go back to normal” and they can resume physical business again.  Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it?This is going to be far bigger than the first wave.If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away.Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade.That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do.There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker.Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will:Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”.

Buoyed by an exuberant heart and his cousin Deng’s tall tales about the United States, Shelley heads to San Francisco to claim his destiny, confident that any hurdles will be easily overcome by the awesome powers of the “Chinese groove,” a belief in the unspoken bonds between countrymen that transcend time and borders.Upon arrival, Shelley is dismayed to find that his “rich uncle” is in fact his unemployed second cousin once removed and that the grand guest room he’d envisioned is but a scratchy sofa. The indefinite stay he’d planned for? That has a firm two-week expiration date. Even worse, the loving family he hoped would embrace him is in shambles, shattered by a senseless tragedy that has cleaved the family in two. They want nothing to do with this youthful bounder who’s barged into their lives. Ever the optimist, Shelley concocts a plan to resuscitate his American dream by insinuating himself into the family. And, who knows, maybe he’ll even manage to bring them back together in the process.Kathryn Ma is the author of the widely praised novel The Year She Left Us, which was named a New York Times Editors’ Choice and an NPR “Great Read” of the year.

I got my first SCOBY after volunteering on a farm on Vancouver Island and have been obsessed with it ever since. Brewing kombucha got me thinking about what I put in my body and how it makes me feel.

I also have a private nutrition practice and specialize in digestive wellness, chronic skin conditions, fatigue, and hormonal issues.

People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop.They are ready to hear your message.Are you ready to give it to them?Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world.You have a voice, it’s time to use it.You have a story, it’s time to tell it.You have a message, it’s time to share it.Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met.That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking.You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you?You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos.You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be.It still feels weird not being able to see people.You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera.You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos.Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change?You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now.When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it.During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields.The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s.I joined the second wave late.  I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube  had been created.I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created.I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016.I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft.When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online.  I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down.  I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses have struggled or even sadly closed up shop.There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too.I knew how to communicate online.I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual.We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom.  We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos.  We still have people who are hoping things will “go back to normal” and they can resume physical business again.  Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it?This is going to be far bigger than the first wave.If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away.Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade.That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do.There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker.Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera.

Led by the best artists in the Bay Area, a revolving cast of incredibly talented musicians grace the stage each week, drawing from the Grateful Dead’s vast catalog to delight Deadheads and dancers of all generations. Matt Hartle will be hosting this edition of Ashkenaz's Grateful Dead Night!Guitarist Matt Hartle was born and raised in rural Pennsylvania, but his playing and his music resonate with a musical and cultural aesthetic that is pure San Francisco Bay Area. His playing exemplifies the uniquely American music form that had it's birth in the Bay Area during the late 1960's and early '70's - a fusion of blues, rock, folk, and jazz performed with an exploratory, and at times mystical, spirit and a penchant for genre bending and blending. After studying jazz and earning a BA in Jazz Performance from the University of North Texas, Matt continued his migration West where he ultimately found his way to the coastal enclave of Santa Cruz, CA where he has made his home since 1995.Hartle is equally at home with, and notably proficient in, bluegrass, folk, straight-ahead jazz, fusion, and all manner of rock, country, and blues stylings. His signature playing style is marked by an instantly recognizable fluidity and sonic intensity which ebbs and flows in organic currents. Ecstatically melodic themes can erupt into blistering torrents of blues-rock fury or devolve into mysterious, dissonant, yearning explorations, or placid contemplations of a multitude of colors, forms, textures and moods. It's no surprise that his fretwork has garnered favorable comparisons to such psychedelic guitar luminaries as Jerry Garcia, Carlos Santana, and Steve Kimock, as well as a host of more traditional fretboard icons, including Lowell George and Mark Knopfler.Though such comparisons are surely well deserved, the attentive listener quickly discovers that despite surface similarities to these guitar greats, Hartle's voice is distinctly his own, distinguished by a unique vocabulary and a complex, deeply engaging sense of phrasing and articulation, with a deep-rooted knowledge of musical style and idiom. To put it simply, Matt Hartle is saying things that haven't been said before.A quick scan of the list of players he has collaborated with gives an indication of the dimensions of his musical affinities: Melvin Seals; Henry Kaiser; Greg Anton; Donna Jean Godchaux; Dave Hebert; Joe Craven; and Stu Allen to name only a few.For the past four years, Matt has hosted the highly successful series ""Grateful Sundays at Michael's on Main.  This ongoing residency has attracted the finest musicians in the Grateful Dead music genre.  While constantly in-demand as a stage and session player throughout the Bay Area, Hartle is also a founding member and musical linchpin of no less than four, Santa Cruz-based bands: Shady Groove - the funky blues, jazz-rock and R&B outfit (a Bay Area favorite going strong since 2001); Painted Mandolin - an acoustic quartet featuring multi-instrumental wizard Joe Craven, of The Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band and David Grisman Quintet; Spirit of 76 - a premier collection of Grateful Dead players, focusing on the jazzy, mid-'70's incarnation of the Dead; and Matt is also renowned as the firebrand lead guitarist of The China Cats, the highly respected Grateful Dead tribute act, a Bay Area favorite.",POINT (37.880098 -122.295894)

Some include a lack of self-confidence (e.g., impostor syndrome), putting other people's needs first, feeling ""not enough,"" and especially people-pleasing.Some of these limitations are rooted in the context in which we live. For example, women are constantly expected to meet society's conflicting demands: practice self-care, spend quality time with family and friends, and be good caregivers. In other words, be extraordinary! How can they feel good enough in an environment demanding more and more from them?In this 1-hour master class, we will explore the people-pleasing pattern and identify the keys to overcoming it. A people-pleaser has an emotional need to please others, often at the expense of their own needs or desires. Some consequences of this pattern include disconnection from yourself (lack of identity), resentment, unsafe relationships, and burnout. Are you a people-pleaser? Let's find out!

In fact, the marketing funnel is the backbone of almost every successful marketing campaign you’ve ever encountered.

I read business books, did research on the Internet but there was never a step-by-step guide to tell me what I needed to do, how, when, or in what order. S﻿o I followed what I was being told and reading about: Wrote my business plan, with a marketing plan and a social media posting strategy. Let me tell you, everything got overwhelming, real fast. Then people started to advise me to go get an MBA. Their reasoning was an MBA would answer all my questions and solve all my business problems. Note: If you have an MBA, I'm proud of you because it is a great accomplishment.I﻿, however, didn't have the time and resources to go back to school for a business degree. See, I was unemployed. When I started my business, my unemployment  checks were coming to the end, really fast. I spent nearly 6 months looking for a new job. My problem was that I was looking for the same type of work I did, for the same pay or higher. That didn't work out. But this is a story for another day.Amongst the chaos, I had a business idea. After an interview, where they went with another candidate, I decided to take a leap of faith to start my own business; a party furniture sales and rental company.F﻿ive years later, I sold part of the furniture company. Now I work completely online creating and selling digital products and services.T﻿his course is a free introduction to the 100 actions I should have taken when I started my business, in the order they are meant to be taken.  I﻿ was doing everything, all the time, in no particular order. But then over time, I begun recording my processes. I found so many areas that I could improved on, if only I had taken certain action at the very start of my business. I realized, I was what I called, ""an after the facts person."" You don't want to be that person in business. It is the worse feeling.O﻿ne very simple example is setting up working hours. Make sure to do this at the very beginning of starting your business. I never thought about doing that. I paid for it dearly and missed milestone events with family and friends. I worked non-stop, 7 days a week and took so much pride in it. And guess what? Since I had no set hours, everyone treated my business like it was open 24/7. Now, I only work from 10am-4pm, Monday to Thursday. When I'm with loved ones, I'm focused on them, not on work. When I go on vacation, I leave my work phone at home. I don't check messages or voicemails, until I return from vacation and back to work.I﻿ want the same thing for you, as an entrepreneur. You deserve happiness while building your business- Stressed and overworked are OUT. Easy navigation systems, working tools and freedom to do your work anywhere are IN.T﻿his introductory course is roughly 15 minutes long. I share with you 100 action items I should have taken, one step at a time.T﻿hen if you want, you can purchase the full course: I go over each step in great details. You'll have access to the slideshows that contain the tools, and the systems  to use and in what order. W﻿HO SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE?E﻿ntrepreneurs or anyone interested in starting a business but don't know how to get started.W﻿HY WOULD I WASTE MY TIME ON YOUR COURSE?T﻿his intro video is roughly 15 minutes long and it's 100% free, no obligations. You can just grab the list of 100 actions and not watch the video. But I want to tell you this, if you spend more than 15 minutes today scrolling on social media, did those 15 minutes help grow your business? I guarantee you will learn something new from my list. Unless learning new things isn't your thing. That, I understand.M﻿Y BUSINESS IS DIFFERENT, IS YOUR COURSE APPLICABLE TO IT?I﻿ had a novel business, throne chairs and I applied the steps in this course to grow my business to 6-figures. I believe my step by step guide can be applied to grow any type of business in 2023 and beyond.W﻿HY WOULD WE LISTEN TO YOU, YOU ONLY GREW YOUR BUSINESS TO 6-FIGURES?Y﻿ou do not have to listen to me. But I have to tell you building a 6-figure business, per year, is not as easy as people think. Some fields, reaching 6-figures right away is the norm. But this is not true for all fields. Believe me, this comprehensive step by step guide will get you to 6-figure much faster than I did. I believe you will have more knowledge than I did when I got started. You will probably build a million dollar business. Your possibilities are based on the actions you take today and in the right order.
